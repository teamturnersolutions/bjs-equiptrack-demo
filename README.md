## 💡 The Problem

Managing shared equipment across a busy warehouse club floor is a daily challenge:

| Pain Point | Impact |
|:---|:---|
| **Paper sign-out sheets** get lost, damaged, or ignored | No reliable record of who has what |
| **No accountability** when equipment is damaged or missing | Increased replacement costs |
| **Slow manual processes** for checking equipment in and out | Wasted labor hours every shift |
| **No visibility** into equipment status at a glance | Supervisors can't make informed decisions |

---

## ✅ The Solution

**EquipTrack** replaces manual tracking with a fast, intuitive digital system purpose-built for the warehouse floor.
